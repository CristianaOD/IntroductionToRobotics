## Homework1_RGB_LED
This assignment focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue) of an RGB LED using individual potentiometers. The components used in this homework include an RGB LED (1), potentiometers (3), as well as resistors and wires as needed. I utilized a separate potentiometer to control each color of the RGB LED: red, green, and blue. This control utilizes digital electronics. I read the potentiometer values with the Arduino and then wrote the corresponding values to the LED pins.
