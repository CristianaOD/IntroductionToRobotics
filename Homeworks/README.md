## Homework1_RGB_LED
This assignment focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue) of an RGB LED using individual potentiometers. The components used in this homework include an RGB LED (1), potentiometers (3), as well as resistors and wires as needed. I utilized a separate potentiometer to control each color of the RGB LED: red, green, and blue. This control utilizes digital electronics. I read the potentiometer values with the Arduino and then wrote the corresponding values to the LED pins.

## Homework2_Elevator simulator wannabe
This  assignment  involves  simulating  a  3-floor  elevator  control  system  usingLEDs, buttons, and a buzzer with Arduino. Through this assignment, I gained experience using button state switching, implementing unlocking techniques, and coordinating multiple components to represent real-world scenarios. The components used in this homework include LEDs  (4:  3  for  the  floors  and  1  for  the  elevatorâ€™s  operationalstate), Buttons (At least 3 for floor calls), Buzzer (1). 
Each of the 3 LEDs should represent one of the 3 floors. The LED corresponding to the current floor should light up. Additionally, another LED should represent the elevator's operational state. It should blink when the elevator is moving and remain static when stationary. 
Implement 3 buttons that represent the call buttons from the 3 floors. When pressed, the elevator should simulate movement towards the floor after a short interval (2-3 seconds).
If the elevator is already at the desired floor, pressing the button for that floor should have no effect. Otherwise, after a button press, the elevator should "wait for the doors to close" and then "move" to the corresponding floor.
