## Homework1_RGB_LED
This assignment focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue)of  an  RGB  LED  using  individual  potentiometers. 
The components used in this homework are 
•RGB LED (1)
•Potentiometers (3)
•Resistors and wires as needed
I used a separate potentiometer to control each color of the RGB LED: red, green, and blue. This control leverages digital electronics. I read the potentiometer values with the Arduino and then wrote the corresponding values to the LED pins
